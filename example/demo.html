		<h1>Custom Scroll Bar</h1>
		<p>The element below is converted into a scrollable area by calling a jQuery function named 'customScrollBar' on it. This function returns an object with three functions:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>getScrollbarWidth</strong>: Returns the scrollbarwidth for the current browser.</li>
			<li><strong>update</strong>: Updates the sizing of the scrollbars. Use this if the node has been changed with the scrollbar active.</li>
			<li><strong>cleanNode</strong>: Clean the scrollbar from the node, returning it to it's original state.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>If your browser/OS is configured to not show scrollbars, the new scrollbars will NOT be applied</p>
		<div id="scroll">
